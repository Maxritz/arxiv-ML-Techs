## Immediate takeaways (highest ROI for a LLM engineering effort)

1. **KV-cache: the easiest wins.** AnchorKV (20× no-discard compression), QEvict (recoverable eviction), SAKI (score-preserving low-rank index), OptR (INT2 with output-aware rotation), and Cross-Model KV Transfer are all drop-in serving/training-independent techniques — start here if serving long-context.
2. **On-policy distillation is the new RLHF hotness.** The OPD cluster (SAF-OPD, FP-OPD, SPOT, FutureBridge-OPD, GRSD, AgentOPSD, Delta-OPD) gives a coherent, label-light post-training alternative with dense supervision; several explicitly fix known OPD failure modes (magnitude/temporal mismatch, capacity gap, exposure bias).
3. **A real MoE training bug + a real MoE inference hazard.** MESH documents and fixes optimizer-state failure on routed experts; "From Expert Reduction to Behavioral Divergence" documents order-dependent nondeterminism in sparse MoE inference. Both are things you must test for.
4. **Eviction/sparse-attention audits exist now.** Sparse-attention selectivity counterfactual audit and Stage-Replay divergence study give you test harnesses to validate that compression actually preserves behavior before shipping.
5. **Test-time scaling finally has a reproducibility framework** (prefix-tree budget formalism) and cheap test-time reasoning (GradCuit, Router-Mem early-exit).
6. **Agentic RL recipes are converging**: hindsight critiques (HindSearch), group reflection (GRSD), observation-calibrated self-distillation, and CoPES (gradient-free post-training) cover the data/reward/training stack for agents.

## 18. Recommended stack for "run a big LLM on weak hardware"

Combining the batch into a concrete pipeline:

1. **Weights → VRAM:** quantize with BaKron (Kron-Hessian-aware) or APQF (sensitivity-guided mixed precision), prune with Celty-style dual sparsity.
2. **KV cache:** AnchorKV (20×) or SAKI/INT2-OptR for the cache; DART/Mamba-2-style recurrent states to remove it entirely where possible.
3. **If VRAM still short → disk streaming:** SALT pin-and-swap pattern for adapters/experts, AcceptMoE cache-residency-aware expert paging, Kilobyte-seed regeneration as the extreme.
4. **If no GPU / CPU-only:** Meganeura (Vulkan/Metal portable kernels) + PRECOG (SSM state injection to kill prefill cost) + ECL for on-device adaptation + Certified Deferral for risk-controlled small-model serving.
5. **If you have multiple weak GPUs:** Meganeura for portability, SparseDitto for per-GPU kernels, split-inference from GQ-FSL/Gecko across nodes, MEC-PPO for scheduling — and **respect the MoE aggregation-order determinism warning (2607.28097)** before sharding experts.
6. **Network/distributed:** relay text (not KV) unless the peer needs private hidden state (2608.04893); use Cross-Model KV Transfer when cascading model sizes; run TELLER-style tracing for debugging.

**Honest gap note:** within this batch there is no paper that directly implements llama.cpp-style CPU weight-streaming, mmap-from-disk weight loading, or a full multi-card tensor-parallel runtime. The closest actionable items are the pin-and-swap (SALT), cache-residency-aware expert offloading (AcceptMoE), split learning (GQ-FSL/Gecko), portable kernel generation (Meganeura/SparseDitto), and the KV-cache compression cluster — plus the determinism warning (2607.28097) that matters before any expert sharding.

# Part 3 — Mechanism Menu (domain-agnostic ideas, any paper in the batch)

Part 2 listed papers already framed for LLMs. This part is the **idea toolbox**: mechanisms from *any* paper in the 992-entry batch that could be lifted and re-targeted to your five goals — reducing VRAM, disk streaming, CPU inference, distributed inference, and parallel use of low-end cards. Nothing here requires the source to be an LLM paper.

| **Communication protocol = the bottleneck, design for it** | [2608.05327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.05327) Collaborative Communication via Coarsening | Provably: a short high-utility protocol exists if communication complexity is small — and designing it can be NP-hard.

| **Growing architecture on each card** | [2608.01475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.01475) Growing nets (see D) | Each weak card can run a *smaller slice* that grows; ensemble of growing slices ≈ one big model over time. | 🎴💾 |
| **Determinism guardrail before sharding** | [2607.28097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.28097) Expert-Reduction Divergence | Any cross-card MoE/expert sharding MUST fix aggregation order; equivalent orders yield different outputs. Test per-machine reproducibility first. | 🎴🌐 |

|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| **Query-aware bit allocation** | [2608.04074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.04074) KV VQ | Spend bits where the query looks — transform derived from a distortion criterion, not a fixed rotation. Pattern: allocate precision by what the consumer actually reads. | 🧠💾 |
| **Anchor-residual decomposition** | [2608.02901](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.02901) AnchorKV | Keep a small exact "anchor" set; express the rest as residuals to their nearest anchor; refine only the impactful ones. Generalizes from KV cache to *any* large tensor/state that must stay resident. | 🧠💾 |
| **Cache-residency-aware eviction/paging** | [2608.02989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.02989) AcceptMoE | Decide what stays resident by expected future commitment (offline-estimated), not just current score — the right policy for disk-paged weights. | 💾🎴 |
| **Restore/regenerate rather than keep everything** | [2608.01247](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.01247) RestoreKV | One cheap adapted pass reconstructs full-cache behavior from a tiny cache. Idea: store a compact "regenerator," derive the big state on demand. | 💾🧠 |
| **Recurrent state instead of growing cache** | [2608.02032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.02032) DART | Fixed-size recurrent state + attention-style decoding from it → long context without a growing KV buffer. | 🧠💾 |

**The meta-idea:** the batch's strongest reusable insight isn't any single paper — it's that the five goals are all the same problem seen from five sides: **"make the working set smaller than the available memory, and only ever pay for what the current query needs."** Seed-regeneration and RRQ solve *disk size*; anchor-residual and residency-aware paging solve *resident size*; dynamic width, early-stop, and CascadeLUT solve *compute spent*; split learning and FedRings solve *what must travel*; SparseDitto and Meganeura solve *where it can run*.
